# Agent Orchestration Blueprint

## Purpose

Codify the **Advisory Hub** methodology: a repeatable workflow where the human operator drives a multi-agent pipeline from raw specification to production-ready code. This skill captures the exact sequence, decision points, and artefacts that emerged from real feature delivery so any future session can follow the same playbook.

---

## When to Use

- Starting a new feature, refactor, or large bug-fix that spans multiple files and sessions
- Resuming a multi-session effort and need to recall the methodology
- Onboarding a new collaborator to the agent-driven workflow
- Auditing whether a completed feature followed the full pipeline

---

## Core Concepts

### Advisory Hub Mode

The operator (human) acts as **orchestrator**. Agents act as an **advisory board** — each specialised, none acting unilaterally. The operator:

1. **Supplies context** — spec files, codebase pointers, domain knowledge
2. **Chooses the next agent** — based on where the work stands
3. **Reviews artefacts** — plans, ADRs, prompts, code, test results
4. **Commits incrementally** — checkpoint after each verified stage

```

│                                                         │
│   The operator is the thread that ties agents together. │
│   Agents never chain autonomously without review.       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Principle: Artefact-Driven Workflow

Every stage produces a **persistent artefact** (markdown file, commit, test run) that the next stage can consume without relying on conversation memory. This is what makes multi-session execution reliable.

| Stage | Artefact | Location |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Requirements | Spec / feature file | Supplied by operator (e.g. `nextprompt.md`) |
| Quick-Win Triage | Commit with passing tests | Git history |
| Architecture | ADR (Architecture Decision Record) | Inside the plan document |
| Planning | Plan document (phases, steps, files) | `.github/plans/<feature>.md` |
| Fidelity Audit | Gap table (0 gaps = pass) | Inside the plan document |
| Risk Assessment | Risk register (scored risks) | Inside the plan document |
| Implementation Prompts | Embedded copy-paste prompts | Inside the plan document |
| Implementation | Code + tests per phase | Git commits per phase |
| Code Review | Review report | Chat session or plan annotation |
| Debug / Polish | Fix-up plan (issues A–N) | `.github/plans/<feature>-fixup.md` |

### Stage 0: Triage & Quick Wins

**Agent:** Planner agent (read-only analysis) → Implement Agent (execute)

**Purpose:** Before any heavy planning, scan the spec for low-effort / high-value items that can be shipped in a single session.

**Process:**
1. Read the full spec input (e.g. `nextprompt.md`)
2. Categorise every item by effort (H = hours, D = days) and value (high / medium / low)
3. Items that are **≤ 1 hour AND high-value** become quick wins (H1, H2, H3…)
4. Implement quick wins in a single session
5. Run full test suite — all tests must pass
6. Commit: `feat: H1–H3 quick wins — <summary>`

**Decision Gate:**
- If quick wins alone satisfy the spec → **done**, no further stages needed
- If remaining work is significant → proceed to Stage 1

**Artefact:** Git commit with passing tests.

---

### Stage 1: Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

**Agent:** Architect Agent

**Purpose:** For non-trivial work, evaluate competing design approaches before committing to a plan.

**Process:**
1. Present the remaining spec items to the Architect Agent
2. Architect proposes 2–4 options with trade-off analysis
3. Each option is scored across dimensions:
   - Implementation complexity (1–5)
   - Maintainability (1–5)
   - Performance impact (1–5)
   - User experience (1–5)
   - Risk level (1–5)
4. Operator reviews, asks questions, selects the winning option
5. ADR is written into the plan document header

**Decision Gate:**
- If the spec is straightforward enough that architecture is obvious → **skip ADR**, proceed to Stage 2
- If there are genuinely competing approaches → write the ADR

**Artefact:** ADR section in the plan document with option scores and rationale.

---

### Stage 2: Plan Creation & Verification

**Agent:** Planner agent

**Purpose:** Create a comprehensive, phased implementation plan that any agent can follow without ad-hoc interpretation.

**Process:**

#### 2a. Plan Authoring
1. Read: spec, ADR (if created), existing codebase patterns
2. Break work into **phases** (each phase = 1 chat session)
3. Each phase contains **numbered steps** with:
   - File(s) to modify
   - What to change (specific enough to implement without guessing)
   - Expected test additions
   - Verification command
4. Place plan in `.github/plans/<feature-name>.md`

#### 2b. Fidelity Audit
After authoring, audit the plan against the spec:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            FIDELITY AUDIT                        │
│                                                  │
│  For EACH requirement in the spec:               │
│    → Is it mapped to a plan step?                │
│    → Is the mapping specific (not hand-wavy)?    │
│                                                  │
│  Produce a gap table:                            │
│  | Spec Item | Plan Step | Status |              │
│  |-----------|-----------|--------|              │
│  | Feature X | Phase 2.3 | ✅     |              │
│  | Feature Y | —         | ❌ GAP |              │
│                                                  │
│  Target: 0 gaps before proceeding.               │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 2c. Risk Assessment
Score each identified risk:

| Risk | Likelihood (1–5) | Impact (1–5) | Mitigation |
|------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| Example risk | 3 | 4 | Mitigation strategy |

- **Showstoppers** (Likelihood × Impact ≥ 16): Must be resolved before implementation
- **Watch items** (8–15): Monitor during implementation
- **Accepted** (< 8): Proceed with awareness

**Decision Gate:**
- 0 gaps in fidelity audit → proceed
- Any gaps → update plan until 0 gaps
- Any showstopper risks → resolve before implementation

**Artefact:** Plan document with fidelity audit table, risk register, and embedded prompts.

---

### Stage 3: Mid-Flight Absorption (When Needed)

**Agent:** Planner agent (or operator + Advisory Hub)

**Purpose:** Handle changes that arrive after the plan is created but before or during implementation. This is inevitable in real projects.

**Triggers:**
- Operator makes independent code changes (e.g. adds a new model field)
- New requirements emerge from stakeholder feedback
- Testing reveals the plan assumed something incorrect
- A dependency changes

**Process:**
1. **Identify the delta** — What changed vs. what the plan assumed?
2. **Trace the impact** — Which plan steps are affected?
3. **Update the plan** — Modify affected steps, add new steps if needed
4. **Re-count** — Update phase sizes, renumber if necessary
5. **Update embedded prompts** — Regenerate any copy-paste prompts that reference changed steps
6. **Commit the plan update** — `docs: absorb <change> into plan — <N> edits`

**Example from practice:**
> Operator added `SCORE_TOOLTIPS` dict to the Pydantic model independently.
> Planner agent traced 16 affected steps, updated them to reference the new dict,
> fixed band name inconsistencies exposed by the change, and regenerated 5 prompts.

**Anti-pattern:** Implementing against a stale plan. Always check if the plan reflects current reality before starting a phase.

**Artefact:** Updated plan document + commit.

---

### Stage 4: Phased Implementation

**Agent:** Implement Agent (one phase per session)

**Purpose:** Execute the plan incrementally, with each session producing a committed, tested increment.

**Process per phase:**
1. Start a **new chat session** (clean context)
2. Provide the phase prompt:
   ```
   Read .github/plans/<feature>.md and implement Phase N.
   Run pytest after every file change. All tests must pass before commit.
   ```
3. Implement Agent reads the plan, executes numbered steps
4. After implementation: run full test suite
5. If tests pass → commit: `feat(<scope>): phase N — <summary>`
6. If tests fail → fix within the same session before committing

**Session Discipline:**
- **One phase per session** — avoids context exhaustion
- **Plan is source of truth** — agent follows the plan, doesn't freelance
- **Tests are the gate** — no commit without green tests
- **No plan edits by Implement Agent** — if a plan error is found, use Debug Agent's plan amendment protocol

**Embedded Prompts:**
The plan document should contain **copy-paste prompts** for each phase. This removes ambiguity:

```markdown
### Phase 2 Prompt (copy into new chat)

> Read `.github/plans/my-feature.md`, specifically Phase 2 (steps 5–9).
> Implement each step in order. Run `pytest tests/ -x -q` after each file edit.
> When all steps pass, commit with message:
> `feat(cards): phase 2 — insight card refactoring`
```

**Artefact:** Git commit per phase with passing tests.

---

### Stage 5: Code Review

**Agent:** Code Reviewer Agent

**Purpose:** Quality gate before declaring the implementation complete.

**Process:**
1. After all phases are implemented, start a review session
2. Code Reviewer reads the plan + all changed files
3. Review criteria:
   - Correctness: Does the code match the plan intent?
   - Style: Consistent with project conventions?
   - Performance: No regressions?
   - Security: No new vulnerabilities?
   - Test coverage: Adequate for the changes?
4. If issues found → send back to Implement Agent with specific fixes
5. If clean → proceed to Stage 6 or declare complete

**Artefact:** Review report (clean pass or list of issues).

---

### Stage 6: Cross-Component Debug & Polish

**Agent:** Debug Agent (analysis) → Implement Agent (fixes)

**Purpose:** After multi-phase implementation, cross-cutting issues often emerge that no single phase could have caught. This stage catches them.

**Triggers:**
- UI inconsistencies across components
- Duplicated data appearing in multiple cards/views
- CSS/styling divergence between independently-built components
- Data model gaps revealed by integration
- Layout issues visible only when all components render together

**Process:**
1. **Audit** — Debug Agent reviews all touched files holistically
2. **Catalogue** — Issues labelled A through N with:
   - What's wrong
   - Where it manifests (file + line range)
   - Root cause
   - Proposed fix (specific enough to implement)
   - Acceptance criteria
3. **Write fix-up plan** — Place in `.github/plans/<feature>-fixup.md`
4. **Execute** — Implement Agent works through issues sequentially
5. **Verify** — Run full test suite + visual inspection
6. **Commit** — `fix(<scope>): post-track cross-component polish`

**Example from practice:**
> After 5 implementation phases, the Debug Agent found:
> - Health Score appearing in both insight cards AND summary card (duplication)
> - Two tooltip CSS functions with different background colours (#4A4A4A vs #1F2937)
> - Card height inconsistency (one card taller due to unused metric)
> - Verbose alert text that should have been simplified
> These became 7 catalogued issues (A–G) in a fix-up plan.

**Artefact:** Fix-up plan document + final commit.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| ❌ Anti-Pattern | ✅ Instead |
|----------------|-----------|
| Jumping straight to code without a plan | Triage → ADR (if needed) → Plan → Implement |
| Implementing all phases in one session | One phase per session — clean context, focused work |
| Letting agents edit the plan document | Only the Planner agent (or operator) edits plans |
| Ignoring mid-flight changes | Absorb changes into the plan before continuing |
| Skipping fidelity audit | Audit every plan — 0 gaps required |
| Committing without tests | Tests pass before every commit |
| Doing handoff chains instead of phased work | Use plan documents for large work, handoffs for emergencies |
| Building the fix-up list from memory | Debug Agent audits files systematically, catalogues issues |
| Trying to fix cross-component issues during implementation | Finish all phases first, then do a dedicated debug pass |

---

## Session Templates

### Starting a New Feature

```
Operator opens new chat:

"I have a feature spec in <file>. Let's use the Advisory Hub approach:
1. Read the spec
2. Triage quick wins (H1–H3)
3. Implement quick wins and commit
4. Then create a phased plan for remaining work

Load .github/skills/workflow/agent-orchestration/SKILL.md for the methodology."
```

### Continuing Implementation (Phase N)

```
Operator opens new chat:

"Read .github/plans/<feature>.md and implement Phase N.
Run pytest after each file change. Commit when all tests pass.
Use message: feat(<scope>): phase N — <summary>"
```

### Post-Implementation Debug

```
Operator opens new chat:

"All implementation phases for <feature> are complete.
Audit all changed files for cross-component issues.
Catalogue each issue (A–N) with root cause, fix, and acceptance criteria.
Write the fix-up plan to .github/plans/<feature>-fixup.md"
```

### Absorbing Mid-Flight Changes

```
Operator opens new chat:

"I independently added <change> to <file(s)>.
Read .github/plans/<feature>.md and update it to absorb this change.
Trace every affected step, update embedded prompts, re-verify fidelity."
```

---

## Checkpoints & Commit Discipline

Every stage that produces code changes should result in a commit:

| Stage | Commit Prefix | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Quick wins | `feat:` | `feat: H1–H3 quick wins — tooltip bands, CSS fix` |
| Plan + ADR (no code) | `docs:` | `docs: create implementation plan + ADR for <feature>` |
| Plan absorption | `docs:` | `docs: absorb SCORE_TOOLTIPS into plan — 16 edits` |
| Phase N | `feat(<scope>):` | `feat(cards): phase 2 — insight card refactoring` |
| Code review fixes | `fix:` | `fix(cards): address review feedback — null guard` |
| Debug polish | `fix:` | `fix(ui): post-track cross-component polish` |

---

## Measuring Success

A well-orchestrated session should produce:

- [ ] **Traceability** — Every spec requirement maps to a plan step, which maps to a commit
- [ ] **Green tests** — Full suite passing after every commit
- [ ] **Clean plan** — Fidelity audit: 0 gaps
- [ ] **Managed risks** — No showstoppers unresolved
- [ ] **Minimal rework** — Debug pass finds cosmetic issues, not fundamental errors
- [ ] **Session efficiency** — Clear context per session, no wasted tokens on re-discovery
- [ ] **Artefact trail** — Plan doc, ADR, prompts, commits, and fix-up plan all exist

## Reference: Real-World Example

The methodology in this document was extracted from the delivery of **Juno UX Polish v2** for the ServeSight dashboard:

| Stage | Artefact | Outcome |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Triage | Commit `ad29844` | H1–H3 quick wins, 393 → 410 tests passing |
| ADR | Option B selected (score 4.1/5) | Micro-frontend hybrid for chat widget |
| Plan | 1035-line plan document | 5 phases, numbered steps, embedded prompts |
| Fidelity Audit | 0 gaps | All 470 lines of spec mapped |
| Risk Assessment | 6 risks, 0 showstoppers | All mitigated |
| Absorption | 16 plan edits | SCORE_TOOLTIPS model change integrated |
| Phases 1–5 | 5 commits | All tests passing per phase |
| Code Review | Clean pass | No issues found |
| Debug | 7 issues catalogued (A–G) | Fix-up plan created |

This end-to-end cycle took **~10 sessions** with full artefact trail and zero rework of fundamental design decisions.
```
