# Architecture Document Generator

Produce formal **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)** documents from the project's living `docs/Architecture.md` and codebase.

> **Project Context** — Read `project-config.md` for brand tokens, org name, tech stack, and project metadata used in document headers.

## When to Load This Skill

- Stakeholder requests a formal architecture deliverable
- Audit or compliance review requires documented HLD/LLD
- Onboarding pack for new team members
- Architecture review board submission
- Project milestone that requires design documentation

## Prerequisites

Before generating, ensure:
1. `docs/Architecture.md` exists and is current (the `@architect` agent maintains this)
2. Architecture diagrams exist in `docs/architecture/*.drawio` (or `.png` exports)
3. `project-config.md` has a profile set (for org name, tech stack, branding)

## Output Formats

| Format | Skill to Load | Best For |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **DOCX** (recommended) | `.github/skills/document-skills/docx/SKILL.md` | Full HLD/LLD — editable, ToC, numbered sections |
| **PPTX** | `.github/skills/document-skills/pptx/SKILL.md` | Executive summary / architecture overview deck |
| **PDF** | `.github/skills/document-skills/pdf/SKILL.md` | Final read-only distribution (generate from DOCX) |

### Content Sourcing

| LLD Section | Source |
|-------------|--------|
| §2 Module Design | Codebase scan (`src/` structure) + `docs/Architecture.md` |
| §3 Data Model | Database schema + `project-config.md` data sources |
| §4 API Design | FastAPI route inspection or API docs |
| §5 Sequence Diagrams | Generate from codebase call flows |
| §6 Class Structure | Codebase scan (imports, classes, modules) |
| §7 Caching | `docs/Architecture.md` caching sections + codebase |
| §8 Error Handling | Codebase patterns (try/catch, error types) |
| §9 Configuration | `.env.example`, `config.py`, `project-config.md` |
| §10 Testing | Test files + `docs/Architecture.md` testing strategy |

---

## Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Sources

```
1. Read docs/Architecture.md (full content)
2. Read project-config.md (profile, tech stack, org name)
3. List docs/architecture/*.drawio and *.png (diagram inventory)
4. If LLD: scan src/ for module structure, key classes, API routes
```

### Step 2: Determine Scope

Ask the user:
- **HLD, LLD, or both?**
- **Output format?** DOCX (recommended), PPTX (exec summary), or both?
- **Which components?** Full system or specific subsystem?

### Step 3: Assemble Content

Map each section to its source (see Content Sourcing tables above). For each section:
- If source content exists → extract and format
- If source is thin → flag with `[TODO: Expand — insufficient detail in Architecture.md]`
- If source is missing → flag with `[MISSING: No content found — update Architecture.md first]`

### Step 4: Generate Document

Load the appropriate document skill:
- **DOCX**: Load `.github/skills/document-skills/docx/SKILL.md` — use OOXML for professional formatting
- **PPTX**: Load `.github/skills/document-skills/pptx/SKILL.md` — use html2pptx workflow

### Step 5: Output

Save to:
- `docs/deliverables/HLD-{project-name}-v{version}.docx`
- `docs/deliverables/LLD-{project-name}-v{version}.docx`
- `docs/deliverables/Architecture-Overview-{project-name}-v{version}.pptx`

---

## Formatting Standards

### Enterprise Document Conventions

- **Font**: Arial or Calibri, 11pt body, 14pt headings
- **Section numbering**: §1, §1.1, §1.1.1 (three levels max)
- **Tables**: Bordered, header row shaded with brand primary color
- **Diagrams**: Captioned ("Figure N: Description"), referenced in text
- **Page headers**: Project name + Document type + "CONFIDENTIAL" (if applicable)
- **Page footers**: Page N of M + Version + Date
- **Line spacing**: 1.15 for body text
- **Margins**: 2.5cm all sides

### Diagram Embedding

For DOCX:
- Embed `.png` exports of `.drawio` diagrams
- Caption each figure: "Figure {N}: {Description}"
- Reference in text: "See Figure {N}"

For PPTX:
- One diagram per slide (full-width)
- Slide title = diagram caption
- Speaker notes = brief description

### Quality Checklist

Before delivering:
- [ ] Every section has content or explicit `[TODO]` marker
- [ ] All diagrams embedded and captioned
- [ ] Table of Contents generated and correct
- [ ] Revision history has current entry
- [ ] Cover page has correct project name, org, date
- [ ] No placeholder tokens (`<ORG_NAME>` etc.) remain — all resolved from project-config.md
- [ ] Section numbering is consistent and sequential
- [ ] Cross-references (e.g., "See §4.2") point to correct sections
```
